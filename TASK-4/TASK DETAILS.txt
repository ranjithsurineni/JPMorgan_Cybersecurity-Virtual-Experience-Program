>>> Here is the background information on your task

You have been asked to design a system that simulates limiting the number of roles a user has at a given point in time. Let’s take a step back and discuss some important concepts behind access control.

Users with more roles increase risk to the organization. If that user’s account was compromised, the attacker would have a significant head start, so to speak. For that reason, administrators would like automation solutions to enforce the least privilege, giving users the minimal set of roles required and removing extraneous roles.

The system you are designing will address one of the many challenges with these systems.

>>>>>>Here is your task

For the fourth module of this project, you will need to accomplish the following:

Set up your system by downloading the necessary files, tools and dependencies.
Complete a coding exercise that simulates a system that manages user roles.
If you have time, review the reference material below in Additional Resources.
You are now ready to work on the coding challenge. The requirements and skeleton are available in task4.py. You will be uploading this file when you are done.

Estimated time for task completion: 1 hour depending on your learning style.
